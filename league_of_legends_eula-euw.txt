The Code of Conduct is not meant to be exhaustive, and Riot Games reserves the right to modify this Code of Conduct at any time, as well as take any appropriate disciplinary measures including Account termination and deletion to protect the integrity and spirit of the Game, regardless of whether a specific behavior is listed here as prohibited.  In addition to this Code of Conduct, please see the Summoner’s Code for additional guidance on exemplary game-play behavior.  The following are examples of behavior that warrant disciplinary measures:

B. Posting identifying information about yourself, or any other user, in the Game;
C. Harassing, stalking, or threatening any other users in the Game;
D. Removing, altering or concealing any copyright, trademark, patent or other proprietary rights notices of Riot Games contained in the Game and/or the Software.  You also may not transmit content that violates or infringes the rights of others, including without limitation, patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, publicity, personal rights or other proprietary or non-proprietary rights;
E. Transmitting or communicating any content which, in the sole and exclusive discretion of Riot Games, is deemed offensive, including, but not limited to, language that is unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, sexually explicit, or racially, ethnically, or otherwise objectionable;
F. Transmitting or facilitating the transmission of any content that contains a virus, corrupted data, trojan horse, bot keystroke logger, worm, time bomb, cancelbot or other computer programming routines that are intended to and/or actually damage, detrimentally interfere with, surreptitiously intercept or mine, scrape or expropriate any system, data or personal information;
G. Spamming chat, whether for personal or commercial purposes, by disrupting the flow of conversation with repeated postings of a similar nature;

J. Accessing or attempting to access areas of the Game or Game servers that have not been made available to the public;
K. Logging out, disconnecting or exiting the Game during live game-play.  Riot Games’ automated Leaverbuster® system tracks this data and may issue temporary bans to users who frequently leave during live game-play.  The length of the temporary ban will increase over time if a particular Account continues to leave during live game-play; or
L. Selecting a Summoner name that is falsely indicative of an association with Riot Games, contains personally identifying information, infringes on the proprietary or non-proprietary rights of third parties, or that is offensive, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, sexually explicit, racially, ethnically, or otherwise objectionable. You may not use a misspelling or an alternative spelling to circumvent this restriction on Summoner name choices.  Riot Games may modify any name which, in the sole and exclusive judgment of Riot Games, violates this provision without further notification to you, and may take further disciplinary measures, including Account termination, for repeated violations.

Such changes will be effective upon your acceptance.  If any future changes to this License Agreement are unacceptable to you or cause you to no longer be in agreement or compliance with this License Agreement, or if at any time you no longer agree with any portion of the then-current version of this License Agreement, we reserve the right to terminate this License Agreement pursuant to our right of termination under clause VIII.

You represent and warrant that you are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any such country or on any such list.
XI. WARRANTY DISCLAIMER
THE GAME (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE SOFTWARE AND THE DOCUMENTATION) IS PROVIDED TO YOU ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.  TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, RIOT GAMES DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WHICH MIGHT APPLY TO THE GAME OR THE SOFTWARE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ANY WARRANTIES THAT MAY ARISE FROM COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE OR USAGE OF TRADE, AND ANY WARRANTIES AS TO THE ACCURACY, RELIABILITY OR QUALITY OF ANY CONTENT OR INFORMATION CONTAINED WITHIN THE GAME AND/OR THE SOFTWARE.  RIOT GAMES DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE GAME AND/OR THE SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED, OR THAT THE SOFTWARE IS FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS.  YOU ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR SELECTING THE GAME AND/OR THE SOFTWARE TO ACHIEVE YOUR INTENDED RESULTS, AND FOR THE INSTALLATION OF, USE OF, AND RESULTS OBTAINED FROM THE GAME AND THE SOFTWARE. 
FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, RIOT GAMES DOES NOT DISCLAIM WARRANTIES FOR INTENTIONAL BREACH OF DUTY.  THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMER DOES NOT AFFECT THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AS SET OUT BELOW.
Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties, the forgoing disclaimer may, in whole or in part, not apply to you. 
XII. INDEMNIFICATION
YOU HEREBY AGREE TO INDEMNIFY, DEFEND AND HOLD HARMLESS RIOT GAMES FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, LAWSUITS, DAMAGES, LOSSES, LIABILITIES AND COSTS (INCLUDING ATTORNEYS’ FEES) THAT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO YOUR FAULT AND ARISE OR RESULT FROM YOUR USE OR MISUSE OF THE GAME AND/OR THE SOFTWARE, OR ANY VIOLATION BY YOU OF ANY OF THE PROVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT.  Riot Games reserves the right, at its own expense and in its sole and absolute discretion, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will cooperate with Riot Games in asserting any available defenses.
XIII. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES, AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, SHALL RIOT GAMES BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF GOOD WILL, OR LOST PROFITS), OR ANY DAMAGES FOR GROSS NEGLIGENCE OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES) ARISING FROM YOUR USE OR MISUSE OF THE SOFTWARE AND/OR THE GAME, EVEN IF RIOT GAMES KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  FURTHER, RIOT GAMES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE IN ANY WAY FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE TO PLAYER CHARACTERS, VIRTUAL GOODS (E.G., WEAPONS, SPELLS, ARMOR, SKINS, ETC.) OR VIRTUAL CURRENCY, RIOT POINTS, ACCOUNTS, STATISTICS, OR USER STANDINGS, RANKS, OR PROFILE INFORMATION STORED BY THE GAME. RIOT GAMES SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY INTERRUPTIONS OF SERVICE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ISP DISRUPTIONS, SOFTWARE OR HARDWARE FAILURES, OR ANY OTHER EVENT WHICH MAY RESULT IN A LOSS OF DATA OR DISRUPTION OF SERVICE.  IN NO EVENT SHALL RIOT GAMES BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF ANY AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO RIOT GAMES FOR GAME-RELATED TRANSACTIONS, IF ANY, DURING THE SIX (6) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE TIME YOUR CAUSE OF ACTION AROSE.
Notwithstanding the aforementioned limitations of liability nothing in this agreement shall limit Riot Games' liability (i) for damage from injury to life, body or health due to negligent breach of duty or intentional or negligent breach of duty by a legal representative or a person used to perform an obligation of Riot Games or (ii) for other damage arising from a grossly negligent breach of duty by Riot Games or intentional or negligent breach of duty by a legal representative or a person used to perform an obligation of Riot Games; (iii) for intentional misconduct; (iv) for damage arising from a negligent breach of an obligation that is essential for the performance of the contract by Riot Games (“Cardinal Duties”) to the extent that is typical and foreseeable; (v) for any guarantee given by Riot Games to you; and (vi) for any liability under a jurisdiction’s applicable product liability legislation.
Because certain states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or the limitation of liability, in such states or jurisdictions, the liability of Riot Games shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.
XIV. EQUITABLE REMEDIES
You hereby acknowledge and agree that Riot Games would suffer irreparable harm if this License Agreement were not specifically enforced.  Consequently, in addition to such monetary and other relief as may be recoverable at law, you agree that Riot Games shall be entitled to specific performance or other injunctive relief, without bond, other security, or proof of damages, as remedy for any breach or threatened breach of this License Agreement.  Additionally, in the event any legal or administrative action or proceeding is brought by either party in connection with this License Agreement and consistent with Section XV below, the prevailing party in such action or proceeding shall be entitled to recover from the other party all the costs, attorneys’ fees and other expenses incurred by such prevailing party as the result of the action or proceeding.
XV. NEGOTIATIONS
A. Negotiations.  Disputes can be expensive and time consuming for both parties. In an effort to accelerate resolution and reduce the cost of any dispute or claim related to this License Agreement (“Claim”), you and Riot Games agree to first attempt to informally negotiate any Claim for at least thirty (30) days (except those Claims expressly excluded in Section XV.B below).  Riot Games will send its notice to the address it has on file to the extent that you have provided additional contact information to Riot Games (e.g. by participating in a promotional or survey, or contacting a customer services representative).  Otherwise, Riot Games will send its notice to the email address associated with your Account.  You will send your notice to Riot Games, Ltd., P.O. Box 11989, Dublin 2, IRELAND, Attn: Legal Department.  Please note that this informal resolution procedure does not suspend any statutory limitation periods applicable to the bringing of a Claim.
 
B. Exceptions to Negotiations. To the extent permitted under applicable law, you and Riot Games agree that the following Claims are not subject to the above provisions concerning negotiations: (i) any Claims seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or Riot Games’ intellectual property rights; (ii) any Claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy or unauthorized use; and (iii) any claim for equitable relief.  To the extent applicable, you further agree not to bring Claims on a representative or class member basis, or as a private attorney general.  In addition to the foregoing, either party may assert an individual action in small claims court for Claims that are within the scope of such courts’ jurisdiction in lieu of litigation.  
 
C. Governing Law. Except as otherwise provided in this License Agreement, this License Agreement shall be governed by, and will be construed under, the laws of Ireland, without regard to conflict of law principles. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.  Other laws may apply if you choose to access the Game from outside of Ireland.  In such an event, those local laws shall affect this License Agreement only to the extent necessary in that jurisdiction, and this License Agreement shall be interpreted to give maximum effect to the terms and conditions in this License Agreement.  You are responsible for compliance with all local laws if and to the extent local laws are applicable. The New Zealand Consumer Guarantees Act of 1993 (the “Act”) may apply to the Game if you access the Game from, and are a resident of, New Zealand.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this License Agreement, if the Act applies then you may have other rights or remedies as set out in the Act which may apply in addition to or instead of those set out in this License Agreement.  If you access the Game from, and are a resident of, the European Community and you are a consumer, you may have other or additional mandatory rights or remedies by law as set out in this License Agreement.
XVI. MISCELLANEOUS
This License Agreement represents the complete agreement between you and Riot Games with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous agreements between you and Riot Games; provided however that this License Agreement shall coexist with, and shall not supersede, the Terms of Use or the Privacy Policy.  To the extent that the provisions of this License Agreement conflict with the Terms of Use, the conflicting provisions in the Terms of Use shall govern.  The Game is operated by Riot Games in Ireland. Those who choose to access the Game from locations outside Ireland do so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws.  Riot Games’ failure to enforce any provision of this License Agreement shall in no way be construed to be a present or future waiver of such provision, nor in any way affect the right of any party to enforce each and every such provision thereafter. The express waiver by Riot Games of any provision, condition or requirement of this License Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of any future obligation to comply with such provision, condition or requirement. If any provision of this License Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be reformed to the extent necessary to make it enforceable to the maximum extent permissible so as to affect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.  If, however, it is determined that such provision cannot be reformed, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.  The provisions of Sections IV, and X through XVI shall survive any termination of this License Agreement.  If you have any questions concerning these terms and conditions, or if you would like to contact Riot Games for any other reason, please contact Riot Games support at support@riotgames.com.
YOU HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THE FOREGOING END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT AND AGREE THAT BY CLICKING “ACCEPT” AND/OR INSTALLING THE SOFTWARE AND PLAYING THE GAME, YOU ARE AKNOWLEDGING YOUR AGREEMENT TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT.
