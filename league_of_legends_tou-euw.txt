III. ACCOUNT INFORMATION

You agree that you will supply accurate and complete information to Riot Games, and that you will update that information promptly after it changes. All of the information you provide to Riot Games will be governed by the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Privacy Policy. The information will be used by Riot Games for a variety of internal purposes, including without limitation, to maintain the Account, to ensure that your Account is unique, to deal with security, debugging and technical support issues, and for possible payment-related issues. You acknowledge that, if any information provided by you is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, Riot Games reserves the right to terminate this Agreement, your Account, and/or your use of the Game. Please note that in utilizing certain areas of the Site (e.g. purchasing merchandise) or the Game (e.g. purchasing Riot Points (defined below)), you will be requested to provide additional information in order to complete a purchase, such as your name, full address, credit card information or other payment information as appropriate to the selected payment method.
Eligibility. Only "natural persons," as opposed to any kinds of legal entities (e.g., corporations, limited liability companies, and/or partnerships), shall have the privilege of establishing an Account. By entering into this Agreement and creating an Account, you represent that you are an adult and have the legal capacity to enter into a contract in the jurisdiction where you reside. You agree to comply with this Agreement on behalf of yourself and, at your discretion, any minor children for whom you are the parent or legal guardian and whom you have authorized to play the Game using your Account. You further agree that you are entirely liable for all activities conducted through your Account, and are responsible for ensuring that you and/or your child is aware of, understands, and complies with the terms of this Agreement and any and all other Riot Games rules, policies, notices and/or agreements.

Any distribution by you of your Account and/or your Login Credentials (except as expressly provided herein or otherwise explicitly approved of by Riot Games) may result in suspension or termination of your Account.
Suspension/Termination.
By Riot Games. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, RIOT GAMES RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SUSPEND, TERMINATE, MODIFY OR DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT IN ITS REASONABLE DISCRETION AND WITH NOTICE TO YOU. For purposes of explanation and not limitation, most Account suspensions, terminations and/or deletions are the result of violation of this Agreement, the EULA, the Privacy Policy, the Summoner’s Code (defined below), or general fraud or Account sales. Additionally, Riot Games may stop offering and/or supporting the Game at any time.
By You. You may terminate your Account at any time, for any reason or no reason, by contacting Riot Games at support@riotgames.com.
By the Community via Crowd Sourcing. Riot Games has empowered its community of users (the "Community") to police the compliance of other users with the "Summoner’s Code", which outlines the principles of ideal game play behavior and can be located on the Site, as well as with other Riot Games policies. Additionally, Community members, including you as a user, are allowed to submit descriptions of activity and actions of certain users within the Game, and collectively determine if that particular user was in compliance with the Riot Games policies relating to user conduct, including, but not limited to, the Summoner’s Code and the Code of Conduct (defined below). This system of allowing the Community to review user behavior in the Game is called The Tribunal®. Should The Tribunal determine that you have acted in contravention of any one of the Riot Games policies, Riot Games may, in its discretion, ban your use of the Game and suspend, terminate and/or delete your Account. The guidelines governing The Tribunal can be found on the Site.

V. FEES; RIOT POINTS; BILLING.
Some aspects of the Game may require you to pay a fee, and you agree that you will provide accurate and complete payment information to Riot and/or the third-party payment provider used by Riot Games. You agree to pay all fees and applicable taxes incurred by you or anyone using an Account registered to you. All fees and charges are payable in accordance with payment terms in effect at the time the fee or the charge becomes due and payable. Depending on your region, there may be multiple payment options available to you. You will be directed to choose the payment method you desire and enter the applicable payment information. Your purchase will be complete upon your acceptance of the payment terms (if applicable) and clicking the "pay now" button, at which point a confirmation email will be sent to you. Depending on the payment method you select, you may be redirected to a third-party payment site, and your transaction will be subject to the third party’s payment rules and processes. Riot Games may, from time to time, modify, amend, or supplement its fees and fee-billing methods, and such changes shall be effective immediately upon posting in this Agreement or elsewhere on the Site or in the Game. Riot Games may, in its discretion, maintain transaction records for as long as it deems reasonably necessary to carry out its business.
If you have a valid, active Account, you may participate in our Riot Points service offering, which is a redeemable point system that operates like virtual currency ("Riot Points") used to license certain Virtual Items. Riot Points can be purchased online through the in-Game store or at retail in the form of a prepaid Riot Games Game Card. Please note that you must register your Riot Games Game Card in the in-Game store in order to access the Riot Points the card contains. Riot Points might also be provided to you by Riot Games as part of a promotion, or through other means, such as completing certain quests or achievements in the Game, or through Riot Games-sponsored contests or sweepstakes. You agree that you will be solely responsible for paying any applicable taxes related to the acquisition of, use of or access to Riot Points. Unless otherwise specified, all amounts due are inclusive of applicable taxes (e.g. VAT). Riot Points are sold or issued in bundles and the price may vary depending on the amount you purchase and where you are purchasing. As Riot Games feels necessary, in its sole and absolute discretion, Riot Games may limit the total amount of Riot Points that may be purchased at any one time, and/or limit the total Riot Points that may be held in your Account in the aggregate. Riot Games will notify you in the event that you near any such limit. Additionally, price and availability of Riot Points and/or Virtual Items are subject to change without notice (to the extent permitted by applicable law). Some Virtual Items you obtain may have expiration dates while others do not, and each Virtual Item you obtain using Riot Points will be included in your Account until the earlier of that Virtual Item’s expiration date, or your Account’s expiration or termination date, or such date when Riot Games ceases to offer or support the Game.
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE RIOT POINTS SYSTEM AND THE VIRTUAL ITEMS YOU ACQUIRE HAVE NO MONETARY VALUE AND CANNOT BE REDEEMED FOR CASH, AND THAT YOU ARE FULLY LIABLE FOR ALL CHARGES TO YOUR ACCOUNT, INCLUDING ANY UNAUTHORIZED CHARGES.
You are responsible for verifying that the proper amount of Riot Points has been added to or deducted from your Account during any given transaction, so please notify Riot Games immediately should you believe that a mistake has been made with respect to your Riot Points balance. Riot Games will investigate your claim, and in doing so, may request some additional information and/or documentation to verify your claim. Riot Games will let you know the results of the investigation, however, you acknowledge and agree that Riot Games has discretion in determining whether or not your claim is valid, and if so, the appropriate remedy. The sale or transfer of Virtual Items or Riot Points between users may only be conducted via services approved of and provided by Riot Games, if any, and Riot Games may terminate any Account that acts in contravention of this prohibition.
NO REFUNDS WILL BE MADE FOR THE PURCHASE OF RIOT POINTS OR FOR VIRTUAL ITEMS OBTAINED USING RIOT POINTS. IF YOU ARE AN EU SUBSCRIBER, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO WITHDRAW FROM A PURCHASE OF RIOT POINTS WITHIN 14 DAYS OF YOUR PURCHASE, WITHOUT GIVING A REASON. YOU HEREBY EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT OF WITHDRAWAL WITH RESPECT TO OUR SERVICE OF PROVIDING YOU RIOT POINTS ONCE THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR SERVICE HAS BEGUN AND YOUR ACCOUNT IS PROVIDED WITH ACCESS TO THE RIOT POINTS. FURTHERMORE, YOU HEREBY EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE, CONSENT AND AGREE THAT THE SUPPLY OF RIOT POINTS AND THE PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES BEGINS IMMEDIATELY AFTER YOU COMPLETE YOUR PURCHASE, AND ONCE ACCESS TO THE RIOT POINTS HAS BEEN ENABLED ON YOUR ACCOUNT, THE CONTRACT HAS BEEN FULLY PERFORMED BY US.
 
VI. CODE OF CONDUCT
While using any of the Properties, you agree to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations. You also agree to comply with certain additional rules that govern your use of the Properties (the "Code of Conduct"). The Code of Conduct is not meant to be exhaustive, and Riot Games reserves the right to modify this Code of Conduct at any time, as well as take appropriate disciplinary measures including Account termination and deletion to protect the integrity and spirit of the Properties, regardless of whether a specific behavior is listed here as prohibited. In addition to this Code of Conduct, please see the Summoner’s Code for additional guidance on exemplary game-play behavior. The following are examples of behavior that warrant disciplinary measures:
Impersonating any person, business, or entity, including an employee of Riot Games, or communicating in any way that makes it appear that the communication originates from Riot Games;
Posting identifying information about yourself, or any other user, to the Site or within the Game;
Harassing, stalking, or threatening any other users in the Game;
Removing, altering or concealing any copyright, trademark, patent or other proprietary rights notices of Riot Games contained in the Site, the Game and/or the Software. You also may not transmit content that violates or infringes the rights of others, including without limitation, patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, publicity, personal rights or other proprietary or non-proprietary rights;
Transmitting or communicating any content which, in the sole and exclusive discretion of Riot Games, is deemed offensive, including, but not limited to, language that is unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, sexually explicit, or racially, ethnically, or otherwise objectionable;
Transmitting or facilitating the transmission of any content that contains a virus, corrupted data, trojan horse, bot keystroke logger, worm, time bomb, cancelbot or other computer programming routines that are intended to and/or actually damage, detrimentally interfere with, surreptitiously intercept or mine, scrape or expropriate any system, data or personal information;
Spamming chat, whether for personal or commercial purposes, by disrupting the flow of conversation with repeated postings of a similar nature;
Participating in any action which, in the sole and exclusive judgment of Riot Games, "exploits" an undocumented aspect of the Game in order to secure an unfair advantage over other users;

Using any unauthorized third party programs, including but not limited to "mods," "hacks," "cheats," "scripts," "bots," "trainers," and automation programs, that interact with the Software in any way, for any purpose, including, without limitation, any unauthorized third party programs that intercept, emulate, or redirect any communication between the Software and Riot Games and any unauthorized third party programs that collect information about the Game by reading areas of memory used by the Software to store information;
Accessing or attempting to access areas of the Game or Game servers that have not been made available to the public;
Selecting a Summoner name that is falsely indicative of an association with Riot Games, contains personally identifying information, infringes on the proprietary or non-proprietary rights of third parties, or that is offensive, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, sexually explicit, racially, ethnically, or otherwise objectionable. You may not use a misspelling or an alternative spelling to circumvent this restriction on Summoner name choices. Riot Games may modify any name which, in the sole and exclusive judgment of Riot Games, violates this provision without further notification to you, and may take further disciplinary measures, including Account termination, for repeated violations; or
Logging out or exiting the Game during live game-play. Riot Games’ automated Leaverbuster® system tracks this data overtime and issues a temporary ban when a user is determined to have left mid-game too many times. The length of the temporary ban will increase over time if a particular Account continues to leave live game play.

XI. WARRANTY DISCLAIMER
THE PROPERTIES ARE PROVIDED TO YOU ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, RIOT GAMES DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WHICH MIGHT APPLY TO THE PROPERTIES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ANY WARRANTIES THAT MAY ARISE FROM COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE OR USAGE OF TRADE, AND ANY WARRANTIES AS TO THE ACCURACY, RELIABILITY OR QUALITY OF ANY CONTENT OR INFORMATION CONTAINED WITHIN THE PROPERTIES. RIOT GAMES DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE PROPERTIES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED, OR THAT THE PROPERTIES ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. YOU ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR SELECTING THE PROPERTIES TO ACHIEVE YOUR INTENDED RESULTS, AND FOR THE INSTALLATION OF, USE OF, AND RESULTS OBTAINED FROM THE PROPERTIES.
FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT RIOT GAMES DOES NOT DISCLAIM WARRANTIES FOR INTENTIONAL BREACH OF DUTY. THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMER DOES NOT AFFECT THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AS SET OUT BELOW.
Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties, the forgoing disclaimer may, in whole or in part, not apply to you.
 
XII. INDEMNIFICATION
YOU HEREBY AGREE TO INDEMNIFY, DEFEND AND HOLD HARMLESS RIOT GAMES FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, LAWSUITS, DAMAGES, LOSSES, LIABILITIES AND COSTS (INCLUDING ATTORNEYS’ FEES) THAT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO YOUR FAULT AND ARISE OR RESULT FROM YOUR USE OR MISUSE OF THE PROPERTIES, OR ANY VIOLATION BY YOU OF ANY OF THE PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE EULA OR THE PRIVACY POLICY. Riot Games reserves the right, at its own expense and in its sole and absolute discretion, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will cooperate with Riot Games in asserting any available defenses.
 
XIII. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES, AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, SHALL RIOT GAMES BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF GOOD WILL, OR LOST PROFITS), OR ANY DAMAGES FOR GROSS NEGLIGENCE OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES) ARISING FROM YOUR USE OR MISUSE OF THE PROPERTIES, EVEN IF RIOT GAMES KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT SHALL RIOT GAMES BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF ANY AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO RIOT GAMES FOR GAME-RELATED TRANSACTIONS, IF ANY, DURING THE SIX (6) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE TIME YOUR CAUSE OF ACTION AROSE.
Notwithstanding the aforementioned limitations of liability NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL LIMIT RIOT GAMES' LIABILITY (i) for damage from injury to life, body or health due to negligent breach of duty or intentional or negligent breach of duty by a legal representative or a person used to perform an obligation of Riot Games or (ii) for other damage arising from a grossly negligent breach of duty by Riot Games or intentional or negligent breach of duty by a legal representative or a person used to perform an obligation of Riot Games; (iii) for intentional misconduct; (iv) for damage arising from a negligent breach of an obligation that is essential for the performance of the contract by Riot Games ("Cardinal Duties") to the extent that is typical and foreseeable; (v) for any guarantee given by Riot Games to you; and (vi) for any liability under a jurisdiction’s applicable product liability legislation.
Because certain states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or the limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such states or jurisdictions, the liability of Riot Games shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.
 
XIV. EQUITABLE REMEDIES
You hereby acknowledge and agree that Riot Games would suffer irreparable harm if this Agreement were not specifically enforced. Consequently, in addition to such monetary and other relief as may be recoverable at law, you agree that Riot Games shall be entitled to claim specific performance or other injunctive relief, without bond, other security, or proof of damages, as remedy for any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement. Additionally, in the event any legal or administrative action or proceeding is brought by either party in connection with this Agreement and consistent with Section XV below, the prevailing party in such action or proceeding shall be entitled to recover from the other party all the costs, attorneys’ fees and other expenses incurred by such prevailing party as the result of the action or proceeding.
 
XV. LEGAL DISPUTES
Negotiations. Disputes can be expensive and time consuming for both parties. In an effort to accelerate resolution and reduce the cost of any dispute or claim related to this Agreement ("Claim"), you and Riot Games agree to first attempt to informally negotiate any Claim for at least thirty (30) days (except those Claims expressly excluded in Section XV.B below). Riot Games will send its notice to the address it has on file to the extent that you have provided additional contact information to Riot Games (e.g. by participating in a promotional or survey, or contacting a customer services representative). Otherwise, Riot Games will send its notice to the email address associated with your Account. You will send your notice to Riot Games, Ltd., P.O. Box 11989, Dublin 2, IRELAND, Attn: Legal Department. Please note that this informal resolution procedure does not suspend any statutory limitation periods applicable to the bringing of a Claim.
Exceptions to Negotiations. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, you and Riot Games agree that the following Claims are not subject to the above provisions concerning negotiations: (i) any Claims seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or Riot Games’ intellectual property rights; (ii) any Claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy or unauthorized use; and (iii) any Claim for equitable relief. To the extent applicable, you further agree not to bring Claims on a representative or class member basis, or as a private attorney general. In addition to the foregoing, either party may assert an individual action in small claims court for Claims that are within the scope of such courts’ jurisdiction in lieu of litigation.
Governing Law. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, this Agreement shall be governed by, and will be construed under, the laws of Ireland, without regard to conflict of law principles. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Other laws may apply if you choose to access the Game from outside of Ireland. In such an event, those local laws shall affect this Agreement only to the extent necessary in that jurisdiction, and this Agreement shall be interpreted to give maximum effect to the terms and conditions in this Agreement. You are responsible for compliance with all local laws if and to the extent local laws are applicable. The New Zealand Consumer Guarantees Act of 1993 (the "Act") may apply to the Game if you access the Game from, and are a resident of, New Zealand. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the Act applies then you may have other rights or remedies as set out in the Act which may apply in addition to or instead of those set out in this Agreement. If you access the Game from, and are a resident of, the European Community and you are a consumer, you may have other or additional mandatory rights or remedies by law as set out in this Agreement.
 
XVI. TERMINATION
This Agreement (and all subsequent modifications, if any) shall remain effective until terminated. Both you and Riot Games may terminate this Agreement at any time with notice to the other. Termination by Riot Games will be effective upon notice to you, termination or deletion of your Account, or its decision to permanently discontinue offering and/or supporting the Game, which it may do at any time in its sole discretion. You may terminate this Agreement at any time simply by not using the Site or the Game. If, however, you wish to terminate your Account, you must affirmatively do so by notifying Riot Games at support@riotgames.com as stated above. Upon termination of this Agreement, your right to use the Properties shall immediately cease.

No Partnership. You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and Riot Games as a result of this Agreement or your use of the Site or the Game.
No Waiver. Riot Games’ failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall in no way be construed to be a present or future waiver of such provision, nor in any way affect the right of any party to enforce each and every such provision thereafter. The express waiver by Riot Games of any provision, condition or requirement of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of any future obligation to comply with such provision, condition or requirement.
Notices. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all notices given by you or required under this Agreement shall be in writing and addressed to: Riot Games, Ltd., PO. Box 11989, Dublin 2, IRELAND.
Reform and Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be reformed to the extent necessary to make it enforceable to the maximum extent permissible so as to affect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. If, however, it is determined that such provision cannot be reformed, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
Section Headings. The section headings used herein are for convenience only and shall not affect the interpretation of this Agreement or have any other legal effect.
Survival. The provisions of Sections IV, V, VII.A, XI-XV, and XVII shall survive any termination of this Agreement.
